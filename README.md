# TotalWarSimulator

This repository contains the code for a flexible and fast simulator that resembles the battles of the [Total War games series](https://www.totalwar.com/).
The main goal of building this simulator is to allow to test Multi-Agent control algorithms in a challenging domain.

You can find more details about me on my [webpage](https://michelangeloconserva.github.io/).
Feel free to drop me an email if you are interested in the project both from the development and the research sides.

At the current state of the project I am using [pymunk](http://www.pymunk.org) and [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/) since they are very good for prototyping, however, depending on the future development objectives, I might switch the code to [Unity](https://unity.com/).


State of the project:
- [x] Core movement for units
- [x] Core commands for units
- [x] Attack between units
- [ ] Archers
- [ ] Cavalry
- [ ] Refactor and add comments
